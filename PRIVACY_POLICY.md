# Privacy Policy for Keep Tabs - Tab Manager

**Last updated: [Current Date]**

This Privacy Policy describes how "Keep Tabs - Tab Manager" (the "Extension") collects, uses, and handles your data when you use our extension in the Google Chrome browser.

Your privacy is extremely important to us. This extension was built to be a tool that respects your privacy.

### 1. Data We Collect

The Extension is designed to help you manage your browser tabs. To provide its features, the Extension collects and stores the following information:

*   **Tab Information**: The URLs, titles, and favicon URLs of the browser tabs you choose to save in "Collections".
*   **Collection Information**: The names and descriptions you give to your Collections.
*   **Extension Settings**: Your preferences, such as the selected theme (light/dark) and other settings.

This data is collected directly from your browser only when you interact with the Extension (e.g., when you click "Save Current Tabs As Collection").

### 2. How We Use Your Data

Your data is used **exclusively** to provide the core functionality of the Extension, which includes:

*   Saving your browsing sessions ("Collections") for later use.
*   Restoring saved tabs and collections.
*   Allowing you to search through your saved collections.
*   Displaying your native Chrome Tab Groups for a unified management view.

### 3. Data Storage and Security

**All data collected by the Extension is stored locally on your computer** using the standard `chrome.storage.local` API provided by the browser.

This means **your data never leaves your computer.** It is **not** sent to, stored on, or processed by any remote server. We, the developers of the Extension, do not have access to your data. The security of your data is tied to the security of your own computer and Google Chrome profile.

### 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to any third parties. This is fundamentally impossible, as we never have access to your data in the first place.

### 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
